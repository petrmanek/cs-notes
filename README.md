Computer Science Notes
======================

Some Computer Science notes I thought I would share with others. So far, they are only in Czech. If you wish, you can help translate them into other languages. The most recent version is available [here](./poznamky.pdf).

## Topics covered so far
- Approximations of combinatorial functions (factorial, binominal coefficients)
- Generating functions and exponential sums
- Finite projective planes
- Flows in networks
- Matchings in bipartite graphs
- Connectivity of undirected graphs
- Ramsey Theory

## Topics left to cover
- Combinatorial codes

## Availability
I made the notes on Computer Science lectures and added some details from other papers. The whole bundle is open sourced and available to the public under the MIT license.
